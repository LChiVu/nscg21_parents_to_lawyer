The research aims to answer the question of whether the education background of an individualâ€™s parents influence the choice of career path, especially in law?

Coefficient Significance:

- Parental Education (`eddad`, `edmom`): Both coefficients are statistically significant, suggesting a positive association between higher parental education levels and the likelihood of becoming a lawyer. This aligns with our hypothesis that emphasize the role of parental education in career outcomes.

- Demographic Factors (`gender`, `racethm`, `bthus`): Gender is not significant, indicating it does not distinguish between lawyers and non-lawyers in the dataset. 
-> Gender is variable of focus, making it a control variable

- The significant effect of being born in the U.S. (`bthusY`) and certain racial categories (e.g., Hispanic) may highlight demographic influences.

- Age: Age is significant, implying that career decisions to become a lawyer may correlate with age, possibly reflecting career development stages or generational effects.
Job Factors:

- Several job satisfaction factors (`facadv`, `facsal`, etc.) were included, but many show non-significance or lead to singularities. We are focusing on variables with siginificance in the refined model: `facben`, `facresp`, and `facsoc`.

Refining the model:

```{r converting facxxx variables, include=FALSE}

                                                                                "Somewhat important",
                                                                                "Somewhat unimportant",
                                                                                "Not important at all",
                                                                                "Logical Skip"))

nscg21$facresp <- factor(nscg21$facresp, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, "L"), labels = c("Very important",
                                                                                "Somewhat important",
                                                                                "Somewhat unimportant",
                                                                                "Not important at all",
                                                                                "Logical Skip"))

nscg21$facsoc <- factor(nscg21$facsoc, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, "L"), labels = c("Very important",
                                                                                "Somewhat important",
                                                                                "Somewhat unimportant",
                                                                                "Not important at all",
                                                                                "Logical Skip"))
```

```{r refined logit model}
# refined model
logit_mod2 <- glm(lawyer ~ eddad + edmom + gender + age + racethm + bthus + facben + facresp + facsoc,
                  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
                  data = nscg21)
summary(logit_mod2)
```

This model refinement from the more complex initial model has simplified the predictors while maintaining significant insights into what influences the probability of becoming a lawyer.

- Higher educational levels of parents, particularly a professional degree, significantly increase the likelihood of the child being a lawyer. 

- Age and being U.S. born also significantly influence the likelihood, with age increasing the odds and U.S. born status showing a strong positive effect. 

- Some workplace factors such as the importance of benefits and social aspects are significant predictors, whereas the importance of responsibility shows a negative effect. 



```{r}
# Check for multicolinearity
vif_vals <- vif(logit_mod2)
print(vif_vals)
```


Looking at the VIF values, none of the variables exceed the common thresholds of concern for multicollinearity (typically 5 or 10 for VIF, ). However, the variables `eddad` and `edmom` have slightly higher VIF values than others (around 2.8-2.9), although these aren't typically alarming levels for logistic regression.

                  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
                  data = data_male)
