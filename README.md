**Data**

The dataset used in this project comprises responses from the [2021 NSCG](https://ncses.nsf.gov/explore-data/microdata/national-survey-college-graduates) survey, focusing on individuals who have pursued careers in law. The dataset includes information on parental education levels, gender, age, race/ethnicity, and job preferences, among other variables.

**Analysis Process**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics and visualizations are employed to understand the distribution of relevant variables among lawyers and judges.
2. **Logistic Regression Modeling:** Logistic regression models are constructed to predict the likelihood of entering the legal profession based on parental education levels, gender, age, race/ethnicity, and other factors. Separate models are developed for males and females to assess differential effects.
3. **Comparison and Interpretation:** The results of the logistic regression models are compared and interpreted to understand the influence of parental education on career trajectories in the legal profession, with attention to gender-specific patterns.

**Results**
The findings of this analysis reveal significant associations between parental education levels and the likelihood of pursuing careers in law. Higher levels of parental education, particularly from fathers for males and mothers for females, are found to increase the odds of entering the legal profession. The results also highlight gender-specific influences, with implications for career counseling and workforce diversity initiatives.
